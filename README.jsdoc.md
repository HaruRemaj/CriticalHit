# Clock module

A simple JavaScript module for generating countdown timers or clocks. Check out `demo.html` for a brief demo of creating a simple clock in the browser and `demo.js` for a demo of using this in [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).

The `demo-debug.html` file shows how to use the `clock-debug` module to debug a clock by adjusting the current time, making testing various scenarios easy.
